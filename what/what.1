NAME

    what - identify SCCS files (DEVELOPMENT)

SYNOPSIS

    [XSI] [Option Start] what [-s] file... [Option End]

DESCRIPTION

    The what utility shall search the given files for all occurrences of the
pattern that get (see get ) substitutes for the %Z% keyword ( "@(#)" ) and
shall write to standard output what follows until the first occurrence of one
of the following:

    "   >   newline   \   NUL

OPTIONS

    The what utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax Guidelines.

    The following option shall be supported:

    -s
        Quit after finding the first occurrence of the pattern in each file.

OPERANDS

    The following operands shall be supported:

    file
        A pathname of a file to search.

STDIN

    Not used.

INPUT FILES

    The input files shall be of any file type.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

    The following environment variables shall affect the execution of what:

    LANG
        Provide a default value for the internationalization variables that
are unset or null. (See the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001,
Section 8.2, Internationalization Variables for the precedence of
internationalization variables used to determine the values of locale
categories.)
    LC_ALL
        If set to a non-empty string value, override the values of all the
other internationalization variables.
    LC_CTYPE
        Determine the locale for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of
text data as characters (for example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte
characters in arguments and input files).
    LC_MESSAGES
        Determine the locale that should be used to affect the format and
contents of diagnostic messages written to standard error.
    NLSPATH
        Determine the location of message catalogs for the processing of
LC_MESSAGES .

ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS

    Default.

STDOUT

    The standard output shall consist of the following for each file operand:

    "%s:\n\t%s\n", <pathname>, <identification string>

STDERR

    The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.

OUTPUT FILES

    None.

EXTENDED DESCRIPTION

    None.

EXIT STATUS

    The following exit values shall be returned:

    0
        Any matches were found.
    1
        Otherwise.

CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS

    Default.

The following sections are informative.
APPLICATION USAGE

    The what utility is intended to be used in conjunction with the SCCS
command get, which automatically inserts identifying information, but it can
also be used where the information is inserted by any other means.

    When the string "@(#)" is included in a library routine in a shared
library, it might not be found in an a.out file using that library routine.

EXAMPLES

    If the C-language program in file f.c contains:

    char ident[] = "@(#)identification information";

    and f.c is compiled to yield f.o and a.out, then the command:

    what f.c f.o a.out

    writes:

    f.c:
        identification information
        ...
    f.o:
        identification information
        ...
    a.out:
        identification information
        ...

RATIONALE

    None.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS

    None.
