-------
1) internationalize all utils:
	* audit utils for internationalization bugs/assumptions.
	* use nl_langinfo(YESEXPR) [or NOEXPR] for ask_question()
	  and similar functions.

2) audit util exit(2) codes, which in some cases differ from POSIX
depends on the error condition.

3) tests for each utility

4) many error messages are "perror(filename)", when they really should
describe the operation that failed, in addition to the filename and
error message.

5) use argp_help(3) for argument parsing-related errors.

6) drepper@redhat.com:
> static unsigned long long n_matches;
> static unsigned long long total_matches;

> Using 'long long' usually indicates "I want something really big".
> While it is not providing any advantages in the moment, you should use
> intmax_t and uintmax_t in these cases.
 
> To print those values using printf (or read them with scanf) use the
> macros in <inttypes.h>.  Don't cast to long long or so.

7) add configure gunk to make quasi-utilities 'chgrp', 'egrep',
and 'fgrep' be installed.
