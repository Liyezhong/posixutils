NAME

    pwd - return working directory name

SYNOPSIS

    pwd [-L | -P ]

DESCRIPTION

    The pwd utility shall write to standard output an absolute pathname of
the current working directory, which does not contain the filenames dot or
dot-dot.

OPTIONS

    The pwd utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax Guidelines.

    The following options shall be supported by the implementation:

    -L
        If the PWD environment variable contains an absolute pathname of the
current directory that does not contain the filenames dot or dot-dot, pwd
shall write this pathname to standard output. Otherwise, the -L option shall
behave as the -P option.
    -P
        The absolute pathname written shall not contain filenames that, in
the context of the pathname, refer to files of type symbolic link.

    If both -L and -P are specified, the last one shall apply. If neither -L
nor -P is specified, the pwd utility shall behave as if -L had been
specified.

OPERANDS

    None.

STDIN

    Not used.

INPUT FILES

    None.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

    The following environment variables shall affect the execution of pwd:

    LANG
        Provide a default value for the internationalization variables that
are unset or null. (See the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001,
Section 8.2, Internationalization Variables for the precedence of
internationalization variables used to determine the values of locale
categories.)
    LC_ALL
        If set to a non-empty string value, override the values of all the
other internationalization variables.
    LC_MESSAGES
        Determine the locale that should be used to affect the format and
contents of diagnostic messages written to standard error.
    NLSPATH
        [XSI] [Option Start] Determine the location of message catalogs for
the processing of LC_MESSAGES . [Option End]
    PWD
        If the -P option is in effect, this variable shall be set to an
absolute pathname of the current working directory that does not contain any
components that specify symbolic links, does not contain any components that
are dot, and does not contain any components that are dot-dot. If an
application sets or unsets the value of PWD , the behavior of pwd is
unspecified.

ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS

    Default.

STDOUT

    The pwd utility output is an absolute pathname of the current working
directory:

    "%s\n", <directory pathname>

STDERR

    The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.

OUTPUT FILES

    None.

EXTENDED DESCRIPTION

    None.

EXIT STATUS

    The following exit values shall be returned:

     0
        Successful completion.
    >0
        An error occurred.

CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS

    If an error is detected, output shall not be written to standard output,
a diagnostic message shall be written to standard error, and the exit status
is not zero.

The following sections are informative.
APPLICATION USAGE

    None.

EXAMPLES

    None.

RATIONALE

    Some implementations have historically provided pwd as a shell special
built-in command.

    In most utilities, if an error occurs, partial output may be written to
standard output. This does not happen in historical implementations of pwd.
Because pwd is frequently used in historical shell scripts without checking
the exit status, it is important that the historical behavior is required
here; therefore, the CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS section specifically disallows
any partial output being written to standard output.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS

    None.
