.Dt SLEEP 1

.Sh NAME

.Nm sleep
.Nd suspend execution for an interval

.Sh SYNOPSIS

    sleep time

.Sh DESCRIPTION

    The sleep utility shall suspend execution for at least the integral
number of seconds specified by the time operand.

.Sh OPTIONS

    None.

.Sh OPERANDS

    The following operand shall be supported:

    time
        A non-negative decimal integer specifying the number of seconds for
which to suspend execution.

.Sh STDIN

    Not used.

.Sh INPUT FILES

    None.

.Sh ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

    The following environment variables shall affect the execution of sleep:

    LANG
        Provide a default value for the internationalization variables that
are unset or null. (See the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001,
Section 8.2, Internationalization Variables for the precedence of
internationalization variables used to determine the values of locale
categories.)
    LC_ALL
        If set to a non-empty string value, override the values of all the
other internationalization variables.
    LC_CTYPE
        Determine the locale for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of
text data as characters (for example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte
characters in arguments).
    LC_MESSAGES
        Determine the locale that should be used to affect the format and
contents of diagnostic messages written to standard error.
    NLSPATH
        [XSI] [Option Start] Determine the location of message catalogs for
the processing of LC_MESSAGES . [Option End]

.Sh ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS

    If the sleep utility receives a SIGALRM signal, one of the following
actions shall be taken:

        Terminate normally with a zero exit status.

        Effectively ignore the signal.

        Provide the default behavior for signals described in the
ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS section of Utility Description Defaults. This could
include terminating with a non-zero exit status.

    The sleep utility shall take the standard action for all other signals.

.Sh STDOUT

    Not used.

.Sh STDERR

    The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.

.Sh OUTPUT FILES

    None.

.Sh EXTENDED DESCRIPTION

    None.

.Sh EXIT STATUS

    The following exit values shall be returned:

     0
        The execution was successfully suspended for at least time seconds,
or a SIGALRM signal was received. See the ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS section.
    >0
        An error occurred.

.Sh CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS

    Default.

The following sections are informative.
.Sh APPLICATION USAGE

    None.

.Sh EXAMPLES

    The sleep utility can be used to execute a command after a certain amount
of time, as in:

    (sleep 105; command) &

    or to execute a command every so often, as in:

    while true
    do
        command    sleep 37
    done

.Sh RATIONALE

    The exit status is allowed to be zero when sleep is interrupted by the
SIGALRM signal because most implementations of this utility rely on the
arrival of that signal to notify them that the requested finishing time has
been successfully attained. Such implementations thus do not distinguish this
situation from the successful completion case. Other implementations are
allowed to catch the signal and go back to sleep until the requested time
expires or to provide the normal signal termination procedures.

    As with all other utilities that take integral operands and do not
specify subranges of allowed values, sleep is required by this volume of IEEE
Std 1003.1-2001 to deal with time requests of up to 2147483647 seconds. This
may mean that some implementations have to make multiple calls to the delay
mechanism of the underlying operating system if its argument range is less
than this.

.Sh FUTURE DIRECTIONS

    None.
